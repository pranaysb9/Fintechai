* **Frontend (Next.js):** A responsive user interface built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. Hosted on Vercel.
* **API Gateway (FastAPI):** A stateless, high-performance API gateway built with Python and FastAPI. It acts as the secure intermediary between the frontend and the data pipeline. Hosted on Vercel as a serverless function.
* **ETL Engine (Pathway):** The stateful core of our data infrastructure. This Pathway pipeline runs as a continuous service, ingesting raw data from Finnhub, processing it in real-time, and exposing a clean data stream. Hosted on Railway.
* **External APIs:**
    * **Finnhub:** Provides the raw, real-time stock market data.
    * **OpenAI:** Powers the RAG chatbot with the GPT-4o-mini model.
